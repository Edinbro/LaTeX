Simple repo where I store all my custom stuff related to LaTeX. Just give it a look to see if you can find something interesting. {^_Â°}

NB: The `apalike-refs.bst` file requires the `hyperref` package. I am looking for help to remove this dependency while preserving the linking feature (or at least not force the user to manually add the package).
